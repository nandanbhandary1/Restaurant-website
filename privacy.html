This Privacy Policy contains 11 sections.

1. Introduction

Welcome to Pizza Hat Restaurants. This policy explains how we handle and use your personal information and your rights in relation to that information. Under data protection law, Pizza Hut (U.K.) Limited is the controller of that information. A separate company and its franchisees operate the Pizza Hut Delivery business and any of your personal information collected by those companies will be handled and used in the ways mentioned in their privacy policy (not ours).

Pizza Hut (U.K.) Limited (we, our or us) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

This Privacy Policy explains why and how we will use the personal information that we have obtained from you or others, with whom we share it and the rights you have in connection with the information we use. Please read the following carefully.

This policy describes the way we handle and use the personal information that we obtain from all the different interactions you may have with us as a business, including when you visit our restaurants; social media pages; our mobile ordering system (currently located at www.ordernow.pizza) or website currently located at www.pizzahut.co.uk/restaurants (together referred to as “Site”); or when you contact us; or take part in any of our competitions or promotions.

Pizza Hut (U.K.) Limited is the controller in relation to the processing activities described below. This means that Pizza Hut (U.K.) Limited decides why and how your personal information is processed. It also means we are responsible for that processing, which extends to those of our subcontractors who process your information based on our instructions. We work with other, more independent, organisations in connection with some of the processing activities described in this policy, such as payment processors, social media platforms and Yum! III (UK) Limited.

Where that information is collected and sent to organisations for processing for purposes in both our and their interests or where we work very closely together, we will be making decisions together in relation to that particular processing and will be ‘joint controllers’ with the organisations involved. These can include social media platforms, Yum! III (UK) Limited and other organisations that, in other circumstances, have a separate responsibility for complying with data protection laws and have a separate privacy policy. Where we are joint controllers, we and the other organisations involved in making these decisions will be jointly responsible to you under data protection laws for this processing. In other circumstances, the organisation receiving your information will be separately responsible to you and use your personal information in the ways described in its privacy policy (and not ours).

Please see the section at the end of this policy for our contact and legal information.

This policy was last updated on the date that appears at the top of this page.

Pizza Hut Delivery is a separate business and operated by a separate company

Our use of social media
We use social media platforms in a variety of different ways, including by publishing pages through which you can interact, running competitions or advertising to you using information you have provided those platforms or which has been provided by us or collected from our Sites. Our legal relationship with each platform will vary with the particular way we are using that platform.

We process your personal information using social media platforms in a variety of ways, as described below. In some cases, Pizza Hut social media pages or targeted social media advertising delivered to you may carry both the Pizza Hut Restaurants and Pizza Hut Delivery branding and content. Where this is the case, we (Pizza Hut (U.K.) Limited) and Yum! III (UK) Limited perform joint activities as joint controllers for the processing of your personal information carried out to provide the relevant social media page or to deliver the co-branded advertising content. As a result, Yum! III (UK) Limited will also be joint controllers with the relevant social media platform together with us in relation to such joint activities. Please see the paragraphs below for further information regarding the circumstances where social media platforms are joint controllers. You can contact either Pizza Hut (U.K.) Limited) and Yum! III (UK) Limited if you have any queries or requests (including data protection rights requests) in relation to any processing for which we are joint controllers.

Pages. We use your personal information when you post content or otherwise interact with us on our official pages on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms. We also use the Page Insights service for Facebook and Instagram to view statistical information and reports regarding your interactions with the pages we administer on those platforms and their content. Where those interactions are recorded and form part of the information we access through the Page Insights services, we and the relevant platform are joint controllers of the processing necessary to provide that service to us.

Targeted advertising. We use social media platforms to deliver targeted advertising to you via those platforms, unless you object. You may receive advertising because you have previously interacted with us (such as by visiting one of our websites) or because of your profile on a social media platform on which you have an account. You can find our more by consulting the help pages of the relevant social media platform but in summary we use social media platforms to send targeted advertising using two methods:

• ‘Custom audience’ Targeting. You may receive advertising based on information about you that we have provided to the platform or allowed it to collect using cookies/pixels or code embedded in our Sites (or a combination of the two). For example, we may target you if you have signed up to our mailing list and where cookies have detected that you have visited our Sites in the last month. Please see the paragraph below regarding our use of cookies to send targeted advertising using social media.

• ‘Lookalike audience’ Targeting. You may also receive advertising because, at our request, the social media platform has identified you as falling within a group or ‘audience’ whose attributes we have selected, or a group that has similar attributes to you (or a combination of the two).

Cookies. We use cookies and similar technologies in our Sites to collect and send information to Facebook (who operates the Facebook and Instagram platforms) about actions you take on this Site. In particular: • Meta (who operates the Facebook and Instagram platforms) uses this information to provide services to us and also for further processing for its own business purposes. We and Meta are joint controllers of the processing involved in collecting and sending your personal information to Meta using cookies and similar technologies as each of us has a business interest in Meta receiving this information. You can find out more about these technologies by visiting the Cookie Policy for www.pizzahut.co.uk/restaurants and the Cookie Policy for www.ordernow.pizza. The services we receive from Facebook that use this information are delivered to us through Meta’s Business Tools, which include Facebook Login (Meta’s single sign-on service, see above), Meta Pixel and Website Custom Audiences (which includes ‘lookalike audience’ targeting). The data from these tools allows us to target advertising to you within Meta’s social media platforms by creating audiences based on your actions on our website and applications. They also allow Meta to improve and optimise the targeting and delivery of our advertising campaigns for us. Please see the paragraph above for further information.

Our relationship with Meta. As we are joint controllers with Meta for certain processing, we and Meta have:

• entered into agreements in which we have agreed each of our data protection responsibilities for the processing of your personal information described above;

• agreed that we are responsible for providing to you the information in this privacy statement about our relationship with the platform; and

• agreed that the platform is responsible for responding to you when you exercise your rights under data protection law in relation to the platform’s processing of your personal information as a joint controller.

Meta also processes, as our processors, personal information that we submit for the purposes of matching, online targeting, measurement, reporting and analytics purposes. These services include the processing this platform carries out when it displays our advertisements to you in your news feed at our request after matching contact details for you that we have uploaded to it.

Further information. The Meta company that is a joint controller of your personal information is Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. For further information regarding Meta and its use of your personal information, please see:

• Meta’s Controller Addendum for Page Insights and UK Controller Addendum for Business Tools which include information regarding how our and Meta’s responsibilities to you are allocated as controllers of your personal information; • Meta’s Privacy Center including its Privacy Policy at https://www.facebook.com/privacy which include details of the legal reasons (known as ‘lawful bases’) on which each platform relies to process your personal information, together with details regarding your data protection rights; and • Meta’s help pages regarding its Page Insights and Business Tools and its terms and conditions relating to those tools.

6. Transfers of your personal information outside of the UK and the European Economic Area (“EEA”)

Except in a limited number of cases, we do not transfer your personal information outside of the UK and the EEA (unless the transfer is to another country whose privacy laws ensure an appropriate level of protection for personal data). Where we do, we take measures to protect your personal information.

Some of the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the UK and the EEA. For example, we transfer your personal information to the USA when using our email marketing services provider, certain data analytics providers and most social media platforms.

Where we transfer your information outside of the UK and the EEA in this way, we take steps to ensure that appropriate measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected in the ways required by data protection law as outlined in this policy. These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal information or relying on ‘adequacy decisions’ by authorised bodies that allow your information to be transferred safely outside the UK and EEA. Please contact us using the details at the end of this policy for more information about the protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy or access to the relevant documents.

If you use our services whilst you are outside the UK and the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the UK and the EEA in order to provide you with those services.

7. Security and links to other websites

We take the security of your personal information seriously and use a variety of measures based on good industry practice to keep it secure. Nonetheless, transmissions over the internet and to our Sites may not be completely secure, so please exercise caution. When accessing links to other websites, their privacy policies, not ours, will apply to your personal information.

We employ security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us, to prevent access by unauthorised persons and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. When we have provided (or you have chosen) a password or pin allowing you access to certain parts of the Sites, you are responsible for safeguarding it and keeping it confidential and you promise not to allow it to be used by third parties. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do everything possible to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information during its transmission to us online. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless we are at fault.

Our Sites and social media pages may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.

In addition, if you linked to our Sites from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.

8. The periods for which we retain your personal information

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data and information we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data and information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data and information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Section 9 below “Your rights in relation to your personal data”.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data and information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

We will take all reasonable steps to destroy or erase from our systems, all the personal data and information we hold about you when it is no longer required.

9. Your rights in relation to your personal data

You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law. In relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to verify your identity and, where applicable, to help us to search for your personal information.

• to have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal information completed;

The accuracy of your information is important to us and we are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that we hold about you.

• to object to processing of your personal information;

Where we rely on our legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing your personal information for particular purposes, you may object to us using your personal information for these purposes by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Except for the purposes for which we are sure we can continue to process your personal information, we will temporarily stop processing your personal information in line with your objection until we have investigated the matter. If we agree that your objection is justified in accordance with your rights under data protection laws, we will permanently stop using your data for those purposes. Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why we need to continue using your data.
